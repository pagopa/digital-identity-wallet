# Digital Identity Wallet - Technical Components

This repository serves as an entry point to the main packages and modules used for implementing the **Wallet Solution** within the [IO app](https://github.com/pagopa/io-app).
The Wallet Solution acts as a **Digital Identity Wallet**, compliant with the **IT-Wallet** guidelines and supporting specifications such as **OID4VCI**, **OID4VP**, and **ISO/IEC 18013-5**.

## üì± Mobile Integration

The wallet is integrated into the [IO app](https://github.com/pagopa/io-app) through a react-native package that contains all the logic of the Wallet Solution.
It provides advanced functionality for:

- Receiving **digital credentials** from authorized Issuers (OID4VCI)
- Presenting credentials remotely in same and cross device flow (OID4VP)
- Presenting credentials in proximity (ISO/IEC 18013-5)
- Support for credentials in SD-JWT and mDOC format
- Validation of the trut framework (OpenID Federation)
- Validation of the credential status
- Registration of the Wallet Instance
- Obtaining the Wallet Attestation
and much more...

## üîê Security Architecture

The implementation adheres to strict technical and security standards, including:

### Secure Key Storage

Secure management of signature keys through platform-specific hardware-based mechanisms:

- **Android**: Uses Android Keystore, preferring **StrongBox** if available, otherwise relying on **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**.
- **iOS**: Keys are stored in the **Secure Enclave**.

Furthermore, this package also contains utilities for managing cryptographic material such as key parsing and X.509 certificate validation.

### Integrity Check & Key Attestation

To ensure runtime and device integrity:

- **Android**: Uses **Play Integrity API** to detect OS and App modifications (e.g., rooting, unlocked bootloader) in addition to verifying that the app has been downloaded from the official stores.
- **iOS**: Uses **DeviceCheck** for verifying device integrity and app legitimacy.

Additionally, **key attestation** ensures that private keys are securely generated and stored in trusted environments.

### Secure Credential Storage

Digital credentials are stored locally and securely using system-provided mechanisms:

- **Android**: Uses **File-Based Encryption (FBE)** with decryption keys tied to user authentication.
- **iOS**: Uses **Keychain Services** protected by the **Secure Enclave**, with fine-grained access control (e.g., `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked`).

## üì° Proximity Presentation

Credential presentation in close proximity is implemented using **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)**, in compliance with **ISO/IEC 18013-5**, which defines secure and authenticated communication between the wallet device and verifier.
